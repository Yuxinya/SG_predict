## Performance on Materials Project dataset

Our model of space group prediction in cubic material is trained with the dataset of 'ML/data.csv' by useing the 'ML/RF_of_us.py'
, and the dataset used for other crystal system training can be downloaded from here [data.csv](https://figshare.com/s/9cfe81a3b087618353c8).
Moreover, the two previous work frameworks for space group classification are also put in the ML folder.

## Environment Setup

To use this machine learning model, you need to create an environment with the correct dependencies. Using `Anaconda` this can be accomplished with the following commands:

```bash
conda create --name SG_predict python=3.6
conda activate SG_predict
conda install --channel conda-forge pymatgen
pip install matminer
pip install scikit-learn==0.24.1
```

## Setup

Once you have setup an environment with the correct dependencies you can install by the following commands:

```bash
conda activate SG_predict
git clone https://github.com/Yuxinya/SG_predict
cd SG_predict
pip install -e .
```

Pre-trained models are stored in google drive. Download the file `model.zip` from from the [figshare](https://figshare.com/s/62da0bce61e4ff038bf7). After downing the file, copy it to `SG_predict` and extract it. the `model` folder should be in the `SG_predict` directory after the extraction is completed. If you do not do this, the model can only make claccification by providing the crystal system information.
## Example Use

In order to test your installation you can run the following example from your `SG_predict` directory:

```sh
cd /path/to/SG_predict/
python predict.py -i full_formula -s crystal_system

for example:
python predict.py -i Zn24Si24Bi16O96 -s cubic
python predict.py -i Zn24Si24Bi16O96
```

The following cyrstal_system values are accepted
```
crystal     # crystal system unknown. 
cubic
hexagonal
trigonal
tetragonal
orthorhombic
monoclinic
triclinic
```
